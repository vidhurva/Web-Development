Practice on Creating a Website Using the HTML and CSS Languages

In particular, I practiced how to organize "dummy" links and columns from HTML using CSS. With CSS, I developed the background color for certain sections of my practice webpage. I also adjusted the margins, display, padding developed .row, .column and used float to organize my content.

Note: I used atom text editor.
